## Getting Started

First, run the development server (NextJS):

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. The port may vary.

1. Connect your wallet
2. Click on "Patient"
3. Register as a patient
4. Upload your before and after image and wait until its uploaded and analyzed
5. Read the analysis


For now, we are using sqlite, but we will use the Lit Protocl and Orbis DB (Blockchain DB) to store medical data.

Everything is on the Base Blockchain.

We are using Filecoin / IPFS / Web3.storage to store before / after images.

# Project Background: Real Life Result Based Health Collective Super Intelligence

## Problem Statement

Humanity is on a health decline. We have a 40% obesity rate, high rates of chronic (joint) pain and more. This needs to be fixed through proper incentives. The demand for health services that actually work will be immense in the upcoiming years as humans physically degenerate over generations.

A huge problem in the health and fitness industry I am seeing is that medical professionals like

physical therapists say that they get results, but don't actually get any long term results with

people.

For example physical therapists still arent able to fix scoliosis despite decades of research.

I think that there is a very obvious reason for this. Its because, similar to the government, they

are not held accountable for their results or lack of results thereof. They arent subject to the

market. Same is the case with most fitness professionals out there that just hide behind

credentialism.

There is a company called FunctionalPatterns(.com) that gets those results on a regular. They

literally fix scoliosis all the time, and even neurodegenerative disease

However, the industry establishment actively fights them because they feel threatened and they

do that by applying credentialism ("I have a PHD and therefore you donâ€™t know what you are

talking about;)". And they also hide behind HIPAA even though its extremely easy to showcase

results if you make your clients sign a waiver. FP does it all the time. Its just an excuse I see

happening in the industry which leaves out millions of people sick and unhealthy.

## Solution

I want to build a decentralized healthcare network, which will include crypto health insurances,

that forces every practitioner or company to showcase unfakeable before and after results.

I suspect, as the health status of humans will get worse and worse, people will desperately need

such a system. The demand will be extreme and I want to get ahead of this problem.

This project is very innovative because it will create an environment that will force health professionals to get results for long term health instead of short term profits.

AI will be used to analyze results and the algorithm will show practitioners that get long term health results with their clients more than others.

Patients will love our platform because the services on our platform will actually work due to proper analysis on longterm health.

### The project is innovative because: The role of AI

- The platform will be completely results based.

- Results will be analyzed by machine learning models eliminating human bias.

- Results can be in the form of before and after pictures, hormone changes or any other

long term health relevant results.

## The project is innovative because: AI Super Study

- All results and the causes of those results will be aggregrated into one immutable and unfakeable super study (unfakeable because Blockchain data is immutable and verifiable). Users will be able to prompt natural language interfaces to figure out how they can tackle their health problems specifically based on that super study, their prompt and their individual medical data.

-- Data will be stored using the Lit Protocol and Orbis DB (a decentralized Blockchain database)

## The project is innovative because: HIPAA Waiver

-- Users can opt in to sign a HIPAA waiver so that their results can be published and showcased online by the practitioner. That incentivizes practitioners to get real life results with their clients. The entire platform will give merit practitioners who get actual results that are deemed as good for longterm health by artificial intelligence based analysis. For example, we will have computer vision models analyze before and after picture of scoliosis results to see if patients are making progress. If they make progress, the methodology used for the progress will be added to the super study.

## The project is innovative because: The role of Blockchain Tech / Base Blockchain

- Pictures will be uploaded to the Blockchain and therefore it will be impossible to edit them from the point on when the image is taken. This will be the same for any kind of

document that proves other types of changes. We will achieve that using ContentSign, a technology that let's you sign any document, picture or video and create a hash of it that is recorded on the blockchain.

- There will be Blockchain health insurances that could partially or fully cover the cost for our users. Those Blockchain health insurances will work similar to things like OpenCover where you can buy insurance for your crypto. People will be able to participate in a pool of funds of the health insurance.

## The project is innovative because: Blockchain Health Insurances

- Blockchain health insurances can pay to particpate on the platform. They can choose to fund our patients to use the methodologies presented on the platform to keep their patients healthy and therefore maximize profits for themselves.

## ID Verification

- We will use Privado ID to identify that the people signing up are real people.

## Lit protocol

- We will use the Lit Protocol to encrypt medical data that is stored on chain in the Orbis DB.

All in all, the project is an extremely innovative approach to fixing our health crisis and desperately needed. People are in pain everywhere and chronic disease is becoming a huge problem and burden on the average joe.
